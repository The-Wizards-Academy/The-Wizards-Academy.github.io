## Security Analysis
- **CRITICAL FLAW: Public Password Hash:** The current authentication mechanism relies on a password hash stored in a publicly accessible `wizard-card.json` file within the user's forked repository.
    - **Problem:** This exposes the password hash to the public. Anyone can view this hash and use offline brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack the original password. This is a severe security vulnerability.
    - **Status:** Mitigated. A clear warning has been added to the UI to discourage the use of real passwords. Given the nature of the project as a challenge, this is an acceptable patch.

## API and Network Issues
- **GitHub API Rate Limiting:** The script makes unauthenticated requests to the GitHub API.
    - **Problem:** Unauthenticated requests are subject to strict rate limiting by GitHub.
    - **Status:** Addressed. API responses for fork checks are now cached in `sessionStorage` to prevent redundant calls and reduce the likelihood of hitting rate limits.

## Error Handling
- **Generic Error Messages:** Some error messages were not specific enough.
    - **Problem:** API call failures for reasons other than a 404 resulted in generic error messages.
    - **Status:** Addressed. The error handling has been improved to inspect the response status code and provide more informative messages for different error types, including 403 (rate limiting), 404 (not found), and 5xx (server errors).
