## Security Analysis
- **CRITICAL FLAW: Public Password Hash:** The current authentication mechanism relies on a password hash stored in a publicly accessible `wizard-card.json` file within the user's forked repository.
    - **Problem:** This exposes the password hash to the public. Anyone can view this hash and use offline brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack the original password. This is a severe security vulnerability.
    - **Recommendation:** This authentication method is not secure and should **NEVER** be used for real user credentials. For the purpose of this application (which seems to be a game or a challenge), this might be an intended feature. However, it's crucial to add a clear disclaimer to the user that they should not use a real, personal password. The entire authentication flow should be reconsidered if this were to be a real-world application, likely moving to an OAuth-based flow (e.g., GitHub OAuth).

## API and Network Issues
- **GitHub API Rate Limiting:** The script makes unauthenticated requests to the GitHub API.
    - **Problem:** Unauthenticated requests are subject to strict rate limiting by GitHub (around 60 requests per hour per IP). This can cause the application to fail for users who are on a shared network or who use the application frequently.
    - **Recommendation:** For a more robust solution, the application should ideally use an authenticated GitHub App or OAuth token to make API requests. For the current static setup, a simple fix is to cache API responses in `sessionStorage` to avoid repeated calls for the same username during a session.

## Error Handling
- **Generic Error Messages:** Some error messages are not specific enough.
    - **Problem:** When an API call to GitHub fails for reasons other than a 404 (e.g., rate limiting, network error), the user sees a generic "Could not check repo forks" message.
    - **Recommendation:** Improve the error handling to inspect the response status code and provide more informative messages to the user. For example, if the status is 403, inform the user about potential API rate limiting.
